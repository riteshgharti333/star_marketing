          <h2>Why analytics marketing matters </h2>
          <p>
            analytics is an essential tool in your wider marketing strategy,
            whether youâ€™re looking to get your social media soaring or support
            your SEO.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind every successful piece of analytics is careful planning and a
            strong strategy to ensure it meets the requirements of not just your
            business, but of the end user. Our team is experienced in planning
            analytics and uncovering audience demand through keyword and
            competitor research.
          </p>
          <p>
            We create unique and compelling analytics, which can be shared via
            your marketing channels, including on your website, social media,
            brochures, and beyond. We are also able to assist in updating
            existing analytics to enhance any untapped SEO potential.
